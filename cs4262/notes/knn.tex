\section*{Nearest Neighbor Classifier}
This is a non parameterized model, this means the model does not assume a fixed form.
The model grows in complexity as data grows and the number of parameters is not fixed.
This makes the model very flexible with essentially no training step. However this require lots of data ans is slow in inference.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Learning step: Store training examples (samples, labels)
	\item Prediction step: To classify a new

\end{itemize}
